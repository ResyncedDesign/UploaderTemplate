## üåü Project Highlights

Your project includes:

- **üöÄ Performance** ‚Äì Great performance with Gofiber
- **üîó Cloudflare R2** ‚Äì Ready for handling file uploads

*Created with ‚ù§Ô∏è by [Resynced Design](https://resynced.design/)!*

## üöÄ Getting Started

### 1. Setting Up Locally

#### Requirements

- **Go** (1.23 or newer)
- **Git** (if you haven‚Äôt installed it, you can [download Git here](https://git-scm.com/))

#### Steps

1. **Download the Project Files**
   - Download the files from the link we provided or from GitHub.
   - Save them in a new folder on your computer.

2. **Open a Terminal**
   - Go to the folder where your project files are saved. 
   - **On Windows**: Right-click in the folder and select "Open in Terminal."
   - **On Mac**: Open Terminal, type `cd`, then drag the folder into the Terminal window to set your location.

3. **Edit the env**
   - Copy the `.env.example` file to `.env` and fill in the required fields.
   - To get your Cloudflare R2 credentials, follow this [tutorial](https://developers.cloudflare.com/r2/api/s3/tokens/).

4. **Start the Project**
   - In the Terminal, type:
     ```bash
     go run src/main.go
     ```
   - The webserver will start, and you can test it with Insomnia or Postman. Or by visiting `http://localhost:<port-you-specified>`.

### 2. Hosting the Project

If you have your own VPS (like DigitalOcean, AWS, or any other hosting service), you can deploy your project there. Follow these steps:

#### Prerequisites

- A VPS with root or sudo access.
- Go installed on the server. You can install it using:
    ```bash
    sudo apt update
    sudo apt install golang
    ```
- An HTTP server like Nginx or Apache for reverse proxy and domain handling.

#### Steps

1. **Upload Your Files**
   - Use SCP, rsync, or FTP software (e.g., FileZilla) to transfer your project files to the server.
   - Example using scp:
        ```bash
        scp -r /path/to/your/project root@your-server-ip:/path/to/your/project
        ```

2. **Set Up Environment Variables**
   - Navigate to your project directory on the server.
   - Copy the `.env.example` file to `.env` and configure it with your Cloudflare R2 credentials and other settings.

3. **Start the Application**
    - Run the following command to start the application:
        ```bash
        go run src/main.go
        ```
    - For production, use a process manager like PM2 or systemd to keep the app running:
        - ***Using PM2***:
            ```bash
            sudo npm install -g pm2
            pm2 start src/main.go --name resynced-uploader
            pm2 save
            pm2 startup
            ```
        - ***Using systemd***: Create a service file at `/etc/systemd/system/resynced-uploader.service`:
            ```ini
            [Unit]
            Description=Resynced Uploader Service
            After=network.target

            [Service]
            User=your-username
            WorkingDirectory=/path/to/project
            ExecStart=/usr/local/go/bin/go run src/main.go
            Restart=always

            [Install]
            WantedBy=multi-user.target
            ```
            Start and enable the service:
            ```bash
            sudo systemctl daemon-reload
            sudo systemctl start resynced-uploader
            sudo systemctl enable resynced-uploader
            ```

4. **Set Up a Reverse Proxy**
    - Install and configure **Nginx** or **Apache** to route traffic to your GoFiber app.
    - Example for **Nginx**:
        ```nginx
        server {
            listen 80;
            server_name yourdomain.com;

            location / {
                proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:<your-app-port>;
                proxy_http_version 1.1;
                proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
                proxy_set_header Connection 'upgrade';
                proxy_set_header Host $host;
                proxy_cache_bypass $http_upgrade;
            }
        }
        ```
    - Restart Nginx:
        ```bash
        sudo systemctl restart nginx
        ```

5. **Enable HTTPS (Optional but Recommended)**
    - Use **Certbot** to install an SSL certificate for your domain:
        ```bash
        sudo apt install certbot python3-certbot-nginx
        sudo certbot --nginx -d yourdomain.com
        ```

6. **Done!**
    - Visit your domain in a browser to see your Resynced Uploader project live!
